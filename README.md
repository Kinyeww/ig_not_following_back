so basically you just paste this file in your directory that contains files like following1 followers...etc 
you just run "python checker.py" in your command.


Note that when you are exporting your information from instagram, its best to choose shorter time range like last year or maybe 3 years, well you still can choose al time bu do take note tha instagram logs everything
so there might be some dead accounts(changed username, got banned...etc) so the result might be inaccurate

also only check this when exporting
